# This script defines the different stages of a CI job to test my DC motor controller using a CICD framework
#
# A pipeline is composed of independent jobs that run scripts, grouped into stages.
# Stages run in sequential order, but jobs within stages run in parallel.


stages:          # List of stages for jobs, and their order of execution
  - check
  - test
  - codeGen
  - webviewGen
  - saveArtifacts

# if the logs path is changed in startup.m (to store the generated logs during pipeline execution), then change it here as well
# as this path ensures that logs are stored as artifacts upto package stage and then HTML Summary report is generated using them
