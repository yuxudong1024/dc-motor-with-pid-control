# The MBD Little Demo #
Controlling a DC motor is perfect to show off a variety of products that are a part of Model Based Design.
The demo is setup to demo a range of products, as well as key modeling features.

The idea is you can open up these demos during any customer call and quickly demo how these products work.

### Relevant Products ###
  * Simulink, Simscape, Simulink Design Optimization, Simulink Control Design, Embedded Coder, Simulink Test, Stateflow

### Simulink Platform Features ###
  * Data Inspector, Signal Editor, Model and Subsystem References, Data Dictionaries, Dashboards, Simulation Pacing, Masks and Callbacks, Apps, (Code) Perspective Views, Test Harnesses, Software-in-Loop Setup, Annotations and Areas
