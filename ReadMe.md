# The MBD Little Demo #
Controlling a DC motor is perfect to show off a variety of products that are essential to Model Based Design.
The demo is setup to demo a range of products, as well as key modeling features.

### Relevant Products ###
  * Simscape
  * Simulink Design Optimization
  * Simulink Control Design
  * Embedded Coder
  * Simulink Test
  * Stateflow

The idea is you can open up these demos during any customer call and quickly demo how these products work.

## Special Instructions
